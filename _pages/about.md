I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Economics at University of Delaware, with research interests in Labor Economics, Household Finance and Development Economics.


I completed my MSc in Economics from the University of Delaware. Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Economics from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), where I graduated with Distinction.
